dicts = {'first_name': 'test1', 'age': 3} no duplicate
tuple is immutable. Therefore, store less in memory. It is faster than list
Tuples are identified by python compiler as one immutable constant so compiler created only one entry in hash table and never changed
Lists are mutable objects.So compiler update the entry when we update the list so it is little bit slower compare to tuple
For just iterating over it, you would use a list.
For looking up keys, use a dict.
Not necessarily slower in the first instance, just that it is not what a dict is intended for.
Looking up by key will be considerably faster (than trying to linearly find an element) if you use a dict, 
and therefore if you are going to use the collection for that purpose, use one. Otherwise do not.
Use set to find existence of a member in a collection. It can improve 40% – 1800% with large dataset

Search cursors can be iterated using a for loop. Search cursors also support with statements 
to reset iteration and aid in removal of locks. 
However, using a del statement to delete the object or wrapping the cursor in 
a function to have the cursor object go out of scope should be considered to guard against all locking cases.

//insert cursor notes
When using InsertCursor on a point feature class, creating a PointGeometry and setting it to the SHAPE@ token is a 
comparatively expensive operation. Instead, define the point feature using tokens
such as SHAPE@XY, SHAPE@Z, and SHAPE@M for faster, more efficient access. Note that Polygon, polyline, or multipoint features 
can only be created using the SHAPE@ token.

Opening simultaneous insert or update operations on the same workspace using different cursors requires the start of an edit session.

The following includes some dataset types that can only be edited within an edit session:

Feature classes participating in a topology
Feature classes participating in a geometric network
Feature classes participating in a network dataset
Versioned datasets in enterprise geodatabases
Some object and feature classes with class extensions

Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

//multiprocessing
I got an error AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Process'
This is because I named the python file as multiprocessing.py and it will compile to multiprocessing.pyc
To fix this delete multiprocessing.pyc and name the file as multiprocessing_example.py. I also got an 
error when the name of the function wrong. Just fix the name of the function

//What are differences between Multiprocessing Queue and Queue Module
Multiprocessing Queue
q = multiprocessing.Queue()
Lives in shared memory
Used to share data between processes

Queue Module
import queue
q = queue.Queue()
Lives in in-process memory
Used to share data between threads


//Two Processes or Threads share resource(Memory, Files, Databases, etc...)
//Example Multiple people share same bathroom. Use Lock to share to avoid two people in at the same time causing problem
